            <h2>Kóndoro</h2>
            <p>In 2014, I co-founded Kóndoro, a company dedicated to 3D printing and prototype manufacturing. Over more than seven years, I led projects encompassing modeling, manufacturing 3D printers, and knowledge management in digital fabrication, including talks, consulting, training, and demonstrations.</p>
