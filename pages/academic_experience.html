        <h2>Current Position</h2>
        <p>Since October 2023, I have been serving as a researcher at the Royal Military Academy in Brussels, Belgium. My work focuses on Sub-Bottom Scanning Sonar (SBSS) for underwater buried target detection, utilizing low-frequency SONAR data and Physics-Informed Machine Learning techniques. This role allows me to integrate my expertise in mechatronics, telecommunications, and applied mathematics to address complex challenges in underwater acoustics.</p>
